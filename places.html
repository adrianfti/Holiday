          <p>
            Welcome to London! Discover the best of London with Visit London,
            the official guide to England’s exciting capital. Find things to do
            in London, from iconic sightseeing spots and fun-filled days out to
            top restaurants, theatre and unmissable London events. You'll find
            the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern. You
            can catch both the Bard's works and modern plays at Shakespeare's
            Globe and its accompanying Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while
            Londoners still praise the power of tea, they now make room for
            Starbucks and Costa Coffees here and there, and pressed juice too.

          <h1>Paris</h1>
          <p>
            The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its
            unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art
            collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River
            Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums,
            centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design
            architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing
            streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful
            bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the
            market, cafe or cinema.

          <h1>New York</h1>
          <p>
            Cool, cosmopolitan, crowded, constantly evolving … the Big Apple
            blends big city splendor with small-town charm. Amid Gotham's iconic
            landmarks and towering skyscrapers, you'll experience a vibrant
            culture permeating each of the city's distinctive neighborhoods and
            boroughs. Follow trendsetters to the East Village and Brooklyn to
            check out indie boutiques, iconic bakeries and trendy coffee shops.
            Afterward, peruse the racks of the sleek shops lining Fifth Avenue,
            admire the cutting-edge art collections at the MoMA and the Met,
            catch a memorable show on Broadway or sit down for a meal at the
            latest "it" restaurant.

          <h1>Singapore</h1>
          <p>
            Immaculate, efficient Singapore is a miraculous sight, particularly
            for travelers familiar with modern Asian metropolises. The city
            maintains a remarkable balance of green space and skyscrapers, in
            addition to sustaining substantial ethnic enclaves like Little India
            and Chinatown. This motley group of cultures has brought to this
            former British colony something special – a common mindset.
            Singaporeans are determined and patriotic; they are proud of what
            they have achieved (just look at Marina Bay and you might get
            jealous).

          <h1>Dubai</h1>
          <p>
            Dubai and Las Vegas have a lot in common. Both cities share a love
            for the fantastical, with skylines that shine like beacons against
            barren desert backdrops. People from all over the world flock to
            these shimmering oases with the same goal: to play hard. But as a
            vacation spot, Dubai easily trumps ol' Sin City thanks to its
            gorgeous cream-colored Persian Gulf shoreline, international
            culinary scene and larger-than-life attractions. And the city's
            still growing. At one point, it was estimated that a quarter of the
            world's construction cranes could be found here. If that's any sign,
            even the sky may not be able to limit Dubai's growth.
